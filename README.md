# Game Inventory Management

A simple Python script that manages a game-style inventory system.  
The program allows you to view, update, and modify items in your inventory, including:

- Displaying the current inventory  
- Adding new items with quantities  
- Renaming items (e.g., upgrading a shield to a magic shield)  
- Exchanging gemstones for health potions  
- Removing items from the inventory  

---

## Features
- Dynamic Updates: Add new items and quantities via user input.  
- Item Upgrade: Automatically transforms "shield" into "magic shield."  
- Item Exchange: Converts gemstones into additional health potions.  
- Inventory Cleanup: Removes obsolete items once exchanged.
